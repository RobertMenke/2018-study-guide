# Personal 2018 Study Guide

During 2018 I'd like to revisit core, fundamental computing concepts that I may not get exposure to during my day-to-day programming.
I'll also take this time to experiment with programming languages that I would like to learn like Go, Rust and Clojure.

This README will serve as a work-in-progress syllabus and checklist for my progress.
